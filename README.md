Repository for my solutions to Codewars katas.
Katas are coding challenges provided by codewars and help in daily programings kills:

The site works like a karate dojo, you earn belts and ranks by solving more and more complex challenges.
 This may help you in your coding.

I code in JavaScript and Python.
